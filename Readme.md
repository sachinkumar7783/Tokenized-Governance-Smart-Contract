# Tokenized Governance Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Tokenized Governance** smart contract enables decentralized decision-making through proposal voting. This contract allows users to create proposals and vote on them, promoting transparent and efficient governance within the Aptos blockchain ecosystem.

## Features

- **Create Proposal**:

  - Allows users to create new governance proposals with a description.
  - Initial vote counts for "Yes" and "No" are set to zero.

- **Vote on Proposal**:
  - Token holders can vote on existing proposals, indicating support ("Yes") or opposition ("No").
  - The vote count for each option is updated accordingly.

## Future Scope

1. **Token-Based Voting Weight**:

   - Implement a system where voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held by a voter.

2. **Proposal Voting Period**:

   - Introduce a mechanism to define a voting period for each proposal, with automatic closing of voting after the period ends.

3. **Proposal Status**:

   - Add functionality to track the status of proposals (e.g., active, closed, implemented).

4. **Detailed Voting Records**:

   - Maintain a detailed record of votes cast, including voter addresses and timestamps.

5. **Proposal Quorum**:

   - Implement a quorum requirement to ensure a minimum number of votes or token holders participate before a proposal is accepted.

6. **Proposal Feedback**:
   - Enable users to provide feedback or comments on proposals, enhancing discussion and refinement.

The **Tokenized Governance** contract enhances decision-making processes by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparent, secure, and democratic governance.
